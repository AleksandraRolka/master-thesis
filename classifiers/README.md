# Jupyter notebooks for _bot / human_ Twitter user account classification using trained models

To test models on example or own data Jupyter Notebooks were prepared.

Using Google Collab instead of local environment user do not need to bother about setup, only Google account is required.

Prepared notebooks to classify a Twitter user account, whether it is a **bot** or a **human** user account use prepared and trained deep neural network models.

> NOTE: Due to changes in access to the Twitter API, script does not allow for automatic data download (for example by user id/username). Free API is no longer available. The data must be prepared in advance in json file. Or just to test model prepared example data can be used.

Currently only models based on only Twitter user data reaches > 70 accuracy, that why for testing only one model from that group is available:

- [Twitter user's data based model](twitter_user_data_based_model/)
  - Google colab notebook available online [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eFb4RME37gZZRIZhXusohbCp_zMS2YyF/view?usp=sharing)
